Current model uses 'ELO' chess formula for:
	- Tennis
	- Snooker
	- Darts

Folder Structure:

	Data - all data currently stored as CSV and Excel files. Includes cleaned data. Some data scraped from online sources

	Scripts

		1. Import and Clean - Data processing files. Prepare consolidated event-level files, with consistent variable names

		2. Analysis - Forecasting files, with validation. ELO logic (with and without additonal 'surface' features split out into seperate files, which we import).
